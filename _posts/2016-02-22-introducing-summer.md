Summer is a one-page, two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Change](https://madebyconnor.github.io/change), another theme by [Connor BÃ¤r](http:s//connorbaer.co).

# Browser support

Summer is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 11 and above.

# Download

Summer is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/madebyconnor/summer) for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
