# üç¶ Summer

## Usage

You'll need to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the `bundler` gem, and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) (`npm` also works) installed on our computer. Summer provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup ‚Äî just clone and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Ruby gems
bundle install
# Node modules
yarn
```

Then simply run `yarn start` to start the Jekyll server on port `4000`.

## Options

Summer includes some customizable options, applied via options in the `_config.yml` file. A standout feature is the dark theme.
Have a look at the [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file for all available options.
